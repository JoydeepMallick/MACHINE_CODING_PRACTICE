This challenging frontend maching coding problem is asked in companies like Amazon Flipkart 

When I was working at The D. E. Shaw Group, I encountered a similar challenge while developing a feature. 

The task was to implement a nested checkbox system: 

### Follow-up 1: 
Generate a recursively nested structure based on a given configuration. 

### Follow-up 2: 
If all child checkboxes are selected, the parent checkbox should automatically be checked. 

### Follow-up 3: 
If the parent checkbox is selected, all child checkboxes should also be selected. 

This problem tests your understanding of `DOM manipulation`, `event propagation`, and `depth-first search (DFS)`.
